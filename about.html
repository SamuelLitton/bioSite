                Paige Litton, born Paige Dionysius, was born on August 23rd, 2001. She was raised in Horicon Wisconsin,
                home of the largest freshwater marsh in the United States, but she would refer to it as the middle of
                nowhere. Paige always wanted to move to a warmer climate and preferably somewhere near the coast.
                Paige and her family moved to South Carolina in 2018, due to her father getting a job with Volvo near
                Charleston. After graduating from high school, Paige decided to continue her education at the University
                of South Carolina. Most of her friends also went to USC, which made this decision easier for her. While
                in college, she decided on her major to be a Doctor of Pharmacy. Paige also met and started to date her
                future husband, Samuel Litton, while in college. They would go on to get married on August 8th, 2022.

                Paige is a busy woman. She takes full time classes at USC, while also working part-time at CVS Pharmacy
                and at Pharmacy Synergistics as a Pharmacy Intern. After graduating from USC, Paige wants to go on to
                become a pharmacist in the field of Managed Care Pharmacy. There she would provide evidence-based
                medicine to large and diverse populations of patients. When Paige has free time, she loves to bake,
                crochet, puzzle, hike, travel, longboard, and frisbee golf. Paige has accomplished many feats that she
                is proud of. Her most recent personal achievement has been winning an election to become Student
                Government Association president-elect. Another fun fact about Paige is that she has traveled to six
                different countries, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Guatemala, England, and France.
